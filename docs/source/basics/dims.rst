Shyhoma Basics
==============

So **what is** shyhoma anyways you might be asking yourself...

Better said as a realm, it was created by the god DaHasu, designed to be the perfect killing machine, Designed to trap people in several different dimensions.

But that might lead to another quesiton "What are dimensions?"

Dimensions, or dims for short, are like different sub spaces in this one realm. There are 20 dims that we know solidly.

Dimensions
==========

**dimension 1**

Endless cube like buildings with a few parking lots. Between them is a void that teleports you to a random building. And the only way to get out of this dim is the few parking lots that have trapdoors. There is a mini market that kills you on enter.

**dimension 2**

A big hallway with Xinu creatures that will kill you if you are insane, just make it to the trapdoor. Many small gaps have been seen too.

**dimension 3**

only dimension that appears in certain order (It always comes last). There is a room with a gatekeeper. You need to describe to him every Dimension you went through in the right order. If you make a mistake he kills you.

**dimension 4**

Is the heart of shyhoma which you only come across it very rarely as its not guaranteed to appear like the others When entering you have an option to hit the heart that frees many other survivors but kills you. To leave just find the trapdoor around it. There are also sounds reported in dim4 before.

**dimension 5**

This dimension is really hard to escape. There is a big maze that if you spent too much time on kills you.You can also see door in the start that of the maze looks like the normal world/earth if you enter it you die and become a Xinu creature out of the many in the maze.

**dimension 6**

Home of sangu and full of their Gu stay quiet and make it to the trapdoor there are also the roaming boats investigation pending...

**dimension 7**

In this dimension there is an exit to dimension 8 but there is also a screen that shows you your family saying bad things about you, standing there for too long will trap you in a place above dimension 3 forever burning with no escape or death watching other survivors escape while you will always feel the pain from the fire.

**dimension 8**

A big wasteland that you have to run very fast and find the trapdoor and escape otherwise you lose your memory and become a hordu, they are creatures in dimension 8 that look like humans. If they grab you their cold body will rot your flesh until you die you can't kill them or escape and if more than one grab you to the point that you can't move resulting to starvation making you a sangu that goes into the real world to grab a human to put in Shyhoma. In that state you are aware but can't control it after you are done you stay in dim 6 forever living as a sangu.

**dimension 9**

A big forest that in the middle has a farm-house and a lake if you wish to leave you have to wander the forest but if you go too far away you'll die. With no indication of how far you've gone the trapdoor is hidden so you have to search the ground to find it but luckily they are plenty. There are many Querts in there that hide in mud that grab you and suffocate you to death.

**dimension 10**

Has a big tower with many floors with different hazards, if you don't want to enter (advised) you can take the stairs at the wall of the tower that lead to dimension 11 what the middle or top parts of the tower contain is unknown.

**dimension 11**

Is a big subway with a constant humming that is caused by the Serdy going too close to it it will rip your head open by the loud noise killing you. She constantly moves. Only way out is staying for 1 minute without hearing the humming making you immune as you get a map with the exit.

**dimension 12**

In this dimension there is a giant creature with an eye that burns you by looking at you. You have to take cover between obstacles so he doesn't kill you
